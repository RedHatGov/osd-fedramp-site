This document is intended to be used by service providers who are applying for an Authorization through the U.S. federal government FedRAMP program.

The Federal Information Processing Standard 199 (FIPS 199) Categorization (Security Categorization) report is a key document in the security authorization package developed for submission to the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) authorizing officials. The FIPS199 Categorization report includes the determination of the security impact level for the cloud environment that may host any or all of the service models (Information as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).  The ultimate goal of the security categorization is for the cloud service provider (CSP) to be able to select and implement the FedRAMP security controls applicable to its environment.

The purpose of the FIPS199 Categorization report is for the CSP to assess and complete the categorization of their cloud environment, to provide the categorization to the System Owner/Certifier and the FedRAMP Joint Authorization Board (JAB) and in helping them to make a determination of the CSP’s ability to host systems at that level.  The completed security categorization report will aid the CSP in selection and implementation of FedRAMP security controls at the determined categorization level.

## SCOPE
The scope of the FIPS199 Categorization report includes the assessment of the information type categories as defined in the NIST Special Publication 800-60 Volume II Revision 1 Appendices to Guide for Mapping Types of Information and Information Systems to Security Categories. 

## SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
The OpenShift Dedicated system has been determined to have a security categorization of Moderate (M).
