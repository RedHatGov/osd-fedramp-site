Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) perform an annual analysis to determine if PII is collected by any of the system components. Clouds that do not collect PII and would like to opt-out of hosting privacy information may elect to do so and are not required to fill out the Privacy Impact Assessment Questions. If a CSP is willing to host PII, the Privacy Impact Assessment Questions should be answered given the current knowledge of the CSP. A CSP is not reqired to solicit customers for this information.

Federal cloud customers (data owner/system owners) are required to perform their own Privacy Impact Assessments, and may share this information with the CSP if they so desire (for informational purposes and/or to work with the CSP to develop processes and procedures for managing their PII).
